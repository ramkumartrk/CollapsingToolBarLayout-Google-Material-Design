    <string name="in_news">The political drama played out through the night in Karnataka Assembly as BJP MLAs slept on the floor of the House, seeking an immediate trust vote. The BJP legislature party members, led by former CM BS Yeddyurappa, were seen having discussions, dining together and sleeping on the green floor and the well of the House.
    The BJP has accused Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) government of dragging its feet on the floor test, despite being moved by CM HD Kumaraswamy. Yeddyurappa also said that the Congress-JDS government was not ready for trust vote as the chief minister does not have the confidence of the people as well as the Assembly.
        But a floor test can be expected today before afternoon. Governor Vajubhai Vala has asked the Kumaraswamy government to prove majority on the floor of the House by 1.30 pm on Friday. Stay tuned to IndiaToday.in for latest updates on Karnataka crisis.
